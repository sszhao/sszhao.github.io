about-header: "Meet Shengdong (Shen) Zhao"
about-description: "I am a full professor at the School of Creative Media and Computer Science Department at the City University of Hong Kong (CityU). Previously, I held the position of Associate Professor at the Computer Science Department of the National University of Singapore (NUS). I obtained my PhD in computer science from the University of Toronto and my master’s degree from the School of Information Management & Systems at the University of California, Berkeley. My undergraduate education included a dual major in computer science and biology from Linfield College, Oregon, USA. In January 2009, I founded the Synteraction (formerly NUS-HCI) Lab. My research focuses on developing innovative interface tools and applications that simplify and enhance people’s lives, such as Draco, which won the Best iPad App of the Year in 2016. I regularly publish in top HCI conferences and journals, including ToCHI, CHI, UbiComp, CSCW, UIST, and IUI. I am also passionate about bridging academic research with industry and have served as a senior consultant with the Huawei Consumer Business Group. Additionally, I actively participate in program committees for leading HCI conferences and have served as the paper co-chair for the ACM SIGCHI conferences in 2019 and 2020. During my leisure time, I enjoy reading, running, and exploring the beauty of nature."
