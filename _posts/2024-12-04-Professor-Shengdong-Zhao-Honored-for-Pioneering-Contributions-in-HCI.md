description: "I'm excited to share some incredible news about my recent work in Human-Computer Interaction (HCI). This year has been marked by significant milestones that I'm honored to highlight.

**GestureGPT: Redefining Hand Gesture Recognition**

Together with the talented Zhang Tengxianâ€™s team, we embarked on an ambitious project titled GestureGPT: Toward Zero-Shot Free-Form Hand Gesture Understanding with Large Language Model Agents. This project addresses the challenge of enabling machines to understand human gestures as naturally and intuitively as humans do. By leveraging large language models (LLMs), GestureGPT combines contextual inference with interaction data to infer user intent, creating seamless and adaptive gesture-based interfaces. Our innovative work has earned widespread recognition, culminating in the Best Paper Award at ACM ISS 2024.

**ICACHI Pioneer Award**

In recognition of our efforts, I am deeply humbled to have received the prestigious ICACHI Pioneer Award. This honor celebrates our pioneering leadership and the lasting foundation we've established for the advancement of HCI.

**Featured in SCM Research Stories**

Our project has also been featured in the SCM Research Stories section, highlighting its potential to revolutionize human-device interaction.

These achievements are a testament to the hard work and collaboration of everyone involved. Thank you to all who have supported us on this journey. I look forward to continuing to explore new frontiers in HCI.

Best, Shengdong Zhao"
