I'm excited to share that our research paper, "GestureGPT: Toward Zero-Shot Free-Form Hand Gesture Understanding with Large Language Model Agents," has been honored with the Best Paper Award at the [ISS 2024 conference](https://iss2024.acm.org/info/awards). 

This achievement is a testament to the hard work and dedication of my colleagues: Xin Zeng, Xiaoyu Wang, Tengxiang Zhang, Chun Yu, and Yiqiang Chen.
