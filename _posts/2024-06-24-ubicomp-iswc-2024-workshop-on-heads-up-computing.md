The UbiComp/ISWC 2024 workshop will focus on "Heads-Up Computing," exploring the future of wearable intelligent assistants like Apple's Vision Pro, Rayban Meta Glasses, and XReal’s Air smartglasses. This event will address design challenges, user interaction, privacy, and ethics in integrating these devices into daily life. 

The workshop invites academics and industry professionals to submit papers by July 5, 2024, with the event scheduled for October 5-6 in Melbourne, Australia.
