Synteraction Lab invites you to a summer Research Camp in the first week of July in Chiang Mai, Thailand. This stunning city, steeped in history and rich in culture, provides an inspiring backdrop to delve into the exciting world of HCI research.

The camp is guided by Prof. Shengdong Zhao, a distinguished figure in the field of HCI. Prof. Zhao is renowned for his thought leadership, extensive research, and commitment to nurturing the next generation of researchers. His mentorship and hands-on approach to teaching promise an enriching educational journey.

The six-day intensive training course offers more than just academic enrichment. Shine during the camp, selected participants could join a research internship project, potentially earning a co-author credit in a publication for the prestigious ACM SIGCHI conference. As part of the internship, these participants will also receive three weeks of free accommodation, allowing them to fully immerse themselves in Chiang Mai's tranquil atmosphere and vibrant culture.

The course fee is 400 SGD if you apply before May 15th. After this date, the cost will be 600 SGD. So seize the early bird offer without delay!

Due to the venue's space limitations, we have fewer than 40 total slots available. Hence, students with previous HCI research experience will be prioritized.

This is a unique opportunity to enhance your research skills, collaborate with experienced researchers, and potentially kick-start your publication journey in HCI. All set against the backdrop of Chiang Mai, a city known for its breathtaking landscapes, historic temples, and friendly locals.

Apply now and make your summer truly enriching in the heart of one of Thailand's most beautiful cities. If you are interested, please fill out the following form. **(https://forms.gle/YqeYqdxHueDPv396A)**

**Frequently Asked Questions**

Q：What is the time of the research camp and what is the activity arrangement? 
A： The research camp will officially start on July 6th. On July 6th and 7th, we will organize some warm-up activities to help everyone get to know each other and become familiar with the surroundings. Following that, from July 8th to 13th, we will conduct a six-day intensive training for the first phase.
After the first phase concludes, outstanding students will be invited to participate in a project internship from July 14th to August 4th, lasting for three weeks. Please note that this is a voluntary activity, and it's okay if students cannot participate for the entire duration. This will be an excellent opportunity for in-depth practice and application of learned knowledge. We look forward to every student gaining valuable experience and growth during this process.

Q：Does the research camp provide accommodation? 
A: Regarding accommodation, during the first phase of intensive training from July 6th to 13th, students will need to arrange and bear the cost of accommodation themselves. For outstanding students participating in the project internship from July 14th to August 4th, we will provide a certain accommodation subsidy. The specific amount of subsidy and the distribution method will be notified to selected students after the selection process is completed.

Q: What are the topics of the research camp? 
A: The research camp cover several important areas related to Human-Computer Interaction (HCI), including:
- Research contribution in HCI - Exploring how research in HCI can create impact and value in the field. 
- Empirical research in HCI - Introducing how to collect and analyze data through observation and experiments to validate HCI theories or improve designs. 
- Constructive research in HCI - Emphasizing solving practical problems through creative solutions and prototype development. 
- Finding the right problem to work with through Quick & Dirty Pilots - Teaching how to identify and define research problems through preliminary quick experiments. 
- Experiment design - Explaining how to design effective experiments to test hypotheses and evaluate interaction systems. 
- Analyzing and interpreting results - Providing methods and techniques to analyze experimental data and extract meaningful conclusions. 
- How to review a paper? - Training participants on how to critically review and evaluate academic papers, an important skill in academic research. 
- Paper writing - Guiding how to write research papers, including structuring, argumentation, and effectively communicating research findings.

These course contents are designed to provide participants with comprehensive knowledge and research skills in the field of HCI, helping them succeed in future research or professional careers.
