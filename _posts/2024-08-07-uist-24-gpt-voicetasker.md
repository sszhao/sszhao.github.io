## Abstract

Virtual assistants have the potential to play an important role in helping users achieves different tasks. However, these systems face challenges in their real-world usability, characterized by inefficiency and struggles in grasping user intentions. Leveraging recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs), we introduce GptVoiceTasker, a virtual assistant poised to enhance user experiences and task efficiency on mobile devices. GptVoiceTasker excels at intelligently deciphering user commands and executing relevant device interactions to streamline task completion. The system continually learns from historical user commands to automate subsequent usages, further enhancing execution efficiency. Our experiments affirm GptVoiceTasker's exceptional command interpretation abilities and the precision of its task automation module. In our user study, GptVoiceTasker boosted task efficiency in real-world scenarios by 34.85%, accompanied by positive participant feedback. We made GptVoiceTasker open-source, inviting further research into LLMs utilization for diverse tasks through prompt engineering and leveraging user usage data to improve efficiency.
